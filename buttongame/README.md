I want to make a game that looks like this game: <https://shawnbeaton.knifecircus.com/Games/Div-Slider/>  

I learned from this tutorial:<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1BW4F774Wo&t=2s>  

But clearly there is some bug in the code. And he didn't show the full code in the tutorial.  

Now my game couldn't work and chatgpt couldn't help me.  

Sorry for that, I'll learn to make a new game next week.
